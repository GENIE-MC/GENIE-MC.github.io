         <b>GENIE recommends:</b>
         <br />
         For large MC productions and physics studies, use
         one of the comprehensive model configurations supported in the latest
         GENIE production release (<B>v3.4.0</B>).
         <br />
         <br />
         To experiment with the latest publicly released physics models and technical
         features, you can (at your own risk) use the development version and/or enable
         non-default options. Please understand that these models and features may
         be experimental and not well validated.

                  produced from a <b>global analysis of folded data distributions from the SBND experiment</b>.
                  This release will be enabled by work to

                  into the SBND analysis software.
                  This effort to combine the most successful and well-motivated
                  empirical and theory-based comprehensive models in GENIE
                  with the full power of SBND data,

                  including a new/improved GENIE default model, amalgamating the long series of Auk physics model
                  developments into new comprehensive and self-consistent descriptions of neutrino-nucleon/nucleus scattering
                  from few hundred MeV to multi-TeV energy scales.

                  and seamless integration into a new series of GENIE Generator production releases.
                  The new GENIE global analysis allows the tuning of large sets of physics parameters (both reweightable
                  and non-reweightable) and the robust estimation of parameter uncertainties and their correlations,
                  and it leads to improved comprehensive model configurations with respect to the ones available in the Bear series.
                  Multiple parameter tunes, from fits to different combinations of datasets, are deployed for each
                  supported comprehensive model configuration.

             New comprehensive model configurations and tunes:
             <ul>
               <li> For every alternative cross-section model construction,
                    released two new comprehensive model variants by incorporating the INCL (Liege) and GEANT4/Bertini FSI codes,
                    in addition to the existing variants incorporating the INTRANUKE/hA and INTRANUKE/hN FSI codes.
                    So, for example, for our G18_02 (theory) cross-section model construction, that incorporates the results of
                    the GENIE 02_11b global analysis, users can obtain the following tunes:
                    G18_02a_02_11b (hA FSI),  G18_02b_02_11b (hN FSI),  G18_02c_02_11b (INCL), G18_02d_02_11b (Bertini).
                    <A href="http://tunes.genie-mc.org/"> Further details on the available tunes can be found here</A>
                    </li>
               <li> Incorporated the <b>final results of the GENIE global analysis of bare-nucleon cross-section data</b>
                    into all G18_[01a-d/02a-d]_<b>02_11b</b> GENIE tunes.
                    Preliminary versions of our results were released in v3.0.0 - v3.0.6 in tunes carrying the label 02_11a.
                    These preliminary (02_11a) were maintained in v3.2.0, but they will be phased out is the next release.
                    Details about this GENIE analysis are published in
                    <A href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.072009" target="_top"> Phys.Rev.D 104 (2021) 7, 072009</A>.

                    </li>
               <li> Released a new set of tunes
                    optimised for our ultra high energy user communities,
                    based on our new NLO DIS cross-section calculation and event generation modules.
                    They are: GHE19_00a_00_000 (BGR18 model), GHE19_00b_00_000 (CMS11 model),

                    New HELepton package, incorporating <b>a) resonant interactions with the nucleon's photon field, and b) coherent

                    These processes were implemented at NLO. In addition, the new HELepton package absorbed old code to simulate the Glashow resonance
                    and was re-implemented at NLO.

             Event generation and core framework improvements:
             <ul>
               <li> Added a new toolkit to generalise and simplify the implementation of cross-section
                    models relying on tabulated hadron tensors.
                    The change underpinned newly developed implementation of the SuSA2 model.
                    Old models were upgared to use the new toolkit</li>
               <li> Complete refactoring of the GENIE decayer and hadronization modules, upgrading
                    decayers and hadronization modules to full-blown GENIE "event record visitors"
                    and eliminating PYTHIA6-specific elements from GENIE interfaces.
                    The change underpinned newly developed interfaces to PYTHIA8. </li>
             </ul>
             Improvements in generator tools (flux and geometry drivers, event generation and other apps):
             <ul>
               <li> Added a new toolkit (EvtLib: Event Library Interface Generator)
                    providing a file <b>interface to external neutrino MC generators</b>.
                    EvtLib allows experiments to run external neutrino MC generators,

                    This is similar to the -e option in our apps for accelerator-based experiments,
                    generating the number of events corresponding to a given data exposure unit
                    (here, proton on target) rather than generating a fixed number of events.

                    </li>
               <li> Added the option to use variable bin width flux histograms in the
                    T2K and FNAL (applicable to all FNAL experiments) specialised event generation apps.
                    Previously, this option for histogram-based flux descriptions existed in the generic event generation app
                    but was left out of the more specialised apps, since the power of these apps is exploited by providing
                    detailed ntuple-based flux descriptions produced by beamline simulations.
                    This update improves these specialised apps for users who wish to use them with simpler flux descriptions.

               <li> Bug fix: Fix an issue with electron (anti)neutrino scattering on Helium.
                    The Smith-Monitz model (like any other RFG model) is not applicable to Helium,
                    and cross-section calculation code was crashing. An ad hoc solution was implemented.

               <li> Bug fix: Fixed two bugs with signs used in the Berger-Sehgal and Kuzmin-Lyubushkin-Naumov
                    resonance models. The fix was installed for clarity and it has no effect,
                    as the wrong signs were cancelling each other out.

                    </li>
               <li> Bug fix: Added code to handle P33(1600) in the GENIE event generation modules. The P33(1600) resonance
                    (a 4-star resonance in 2019 PDG) was added in the GENIE v3 cross-section calculations but,
                    due to missing resonance data, the resonance was ignored during event generation.
                    In versions affected by this bug, P33(1600) is added as a "Rootino" (pseudo-particle PDG code = 0)
                    and its decay is not simulated.

                    </li>
               <li> Bug fix: Fixed a mistake in BaryonResonanceDecayer::IsHandled() (returned input PDG code, as opposed
                    to the correct boolean flag).
                    </li>
               <li> Bug fix: Installed a fix in AGCharm2019 hadronizatiom model, allowing the production of charmed-mesons
                    (D+, D_s and D0) above a previously existing cutoff value of 100 GeV.

               <li> Correct handling of the hit nucleon radius during CCQE spline integration in v3.0.4.
                    This leads to an unphysical suppression of the CCQE total cross section at low energies
                    for all GENIE model sets that use a local Fermi gas model (the G18_10 series).
                    Other model sets are unaffected by this issue. More details about this problem are

             <ul>
               <li> Previously, Pauli blocking for quasielastic event was implemented as a suppression factor which was
                    computed analytically. The calculation was valid only for a Fermi Gas model. Pauli blocking is now
                    implemented in a more generic way, as a cut on the outgoing nucleon momentum, allowing for correct
                    calculation of the effect irrespectively of the assumed nucleon momentum distribution.
               <li> Bug fix: Removal energy was ignored by the quasielastic event generator, which always put the struck
                    nucleon on the mass shell.</li>
               <li> Bug fix: In the GENIE implementation of the Valenia model, an incorrect reference frame was used to compute
                    the contraction of the leptonic and hadronic tensors. </li>
               <li> Bug fix: In the GENIE implementation of the Valenia model, a Coulomb correction was implemented only
                    as an overall scaling factor in the differential correction, an ignored the effect on the 3-momentum transfer.</li>
               <li> Bug fix: In the quasielastic event generation, there was a single instance of Q<sup>2</sup> miscalculation
                    due to a mismatch of the reference frames of the neutrino and final-state primary lepton momentum 4-vectors.</li>
               <li> Bug fix: In the GENIE implementation of the Valenia model, in the calculation of the Coulomb correction
                    through an integral over the nuclear volume, integration limits did not account for the A<sup>1/3</sup>
                    grow of the nuclear radius, resulting in a correction that was too small for heavy nuclei.</li>
               <li> Bug fix: In the GENIE implementation of the Valenia model, explicit forms of the hadron tensors should be
                    evaluated in the lab frame with coordinates rotated so that the Coulomb-corrected 3-momentum transfer points
                    along the positive z direction. Previously, the Coulomb correction was not applied in the edge case where
                    the uncorrected 3-momentum transfer was pointing along the negative z direction. </li>
               <li> Bug fix: Previously, in the new quasielastic event generator first included in v3,
                    Fermi motion was erroneously applied to free nucleon targets.
               <li> Bug fix: Previously, Pauli blocking was erroneously applied in the simulation of
                    quasielastic charm production. </li>
               <li> Bug fix: In the simulation of the &Delta; &rightarrow; N + &pi; decay, the polar angle &theta;
                    was defined wrt to the z axis, rather than wrt to the direction of the momentum-transfer vector
                    in the &Delta; CM frame. </li>
               <li> Bug fix: The invariant mass threshold for deep-inelastic events was inadvertently set to the
                    nucleon mass, when the corresponding threshold for resonance events was modified to allow simulation of
                    &Delta; &rightarrow; N + &pi; decays below the pion production threshold.
                    The threshold for deep-inelastic events is now set back to the sum of the nucleon and pion masses.</li>

              We are pleased to announce a major new release, the first in more than a decade, and the start of the Bear series.
              <br />
              <br />
              Release v3.0.0 <b>consolidates a series of physics modelling improvements</b> installed over the past 5 years.
              It also represents a <b>major shift in philosophy</b>: Instead of a single "Default" model with optional
              modelling elements that can be enabled by users, at own risk, GENIE now constructs, deploys and supports
              <b>multiple comprehensive model configurations that run out the box</b>.
              Special care was taken to combine models in a way that consistency
              is ensured, double-counting is removed, and updated model parameter estimations are made to take into account
              the impact of experimental constraints on the specific mixture of models in each given configuration.
              Full characterization of comprehensive models and tunes is performed using detailed data/MC comparisons.
              <br />
              <br />
              Between 2015-2018, GENIE implemented a <b>powerfull new global analysis of neutrino scattering data</b>.
              The analysis relies on the <i>Comparisons</i> product, which includes <b>extensive curated archives of neutrino,
              charged-lepton and hadron scattering data</b>, as well as highly-developed software to produce a
              <b>comprehensive set of data/MC comparisons</b>. <i>Comparisons</i> includes <b>interfaces to the
              <A href="https://professor.hepforge.org">Professor</A> tuning tool</b>
              which "<i>reduces the exponentially expensive process of brute-force tuning to a scaling closer to a power
              law in the number of parameters and allows for massive parallelisation</i>".
              This enabled the generation of several new tunes, a selection of which was <b>fully integrated in the
              <i>Generator</i> product</b> and was made available in GENIE v3.0.0
              (see <A href="./tunes.html">here</A> for the current list of publicly available tunes).
              Nuclear cross-section and hadronization tunes are ongoing and additional tunes
              will be made available in future revisions.
              <br />
              <br />
              The new release constitutes a major technical upgrade, with important modifications in the core framework,
              in particular the configuration system, and a re-organization of the entire source tree.
              Please also note that from v3.0.0, Reweight is distributed as a separate product in the family of the GENIE
              products that also includes the Generator, Comparisons, and Tuning products.
              <br />
              <br />
              Details for GENIE v3.0.0 and its new tunes will be made available in a near-future publications.

                  Several new physics models were installed and made available in the Auk series as optional alternatives of the established

             <br>Physics changes:</br>

             <ul>
                <li>Added Helium in the Valencia (NSV) MEC model, to be generated using the Carbon hadron tensor and the regular scaling function. Also we now let the code go down to Be9, a default GENIE isotope.</li>
                <li>Activated lines in pdg table for two pseudonuclei made of pp and nn, so that generation on Helium can proceed but didn't activate (kept commented out) the decay modes (must be handled in code directly).</li>

             <br>Non-physics changes:</br>

             <ul>
                <li>Added new event generator lists: CCinclMEC+NueEl, duplicated Default+MEC as Default+CCMEC to avoid ambiguity, and added Default+CCMEC+NCMEC.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug in variable initialization in `GFLUKAAtmoFlux.cxx` pointed out by the community (Tao Lin).M/li>
                <li>Fixed a bug in the Valencia (NSV) MEC model in the scaling function that affected calculation for the neutrino case. The bug only affects nuclei scaled away from a hadtensor. There was no effect on C, O, Ca40, Pb.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug in the Valencia (NSV) MEC model that set a too-low XSecMax for O and maybe N14.  The XSecMax has been increased to be more safe.</li>
                <li>Bugfix: The use of NucBindE was disabled in the Valencia (NSV) MEC model for 2p2h in 2.12. Therefore, we now add the resulting removal energy directly to the remnant nucleus.</li>

                <li>Fix a bug that caused unnecessary warning spew when computing cross section for pions with kinetic energy over 1 GeV in the BergerSehgalFMCohPi model - now use Rein-Sehgal formulation more explicitly in that case. This is very close to what we were doing before, but somewhat awkwardly. Additionally, the old effective switch-over was for a pion kinetic energy less than 1 GeV (by the pion mass) rather than at 1 GeV.</li>

                <li>Fixed a bug that causes that floats to be sometimes printed in hexadecimal format in C++11.</li>
                <li>Recovered a lost patch to the Makefiles (present in 2-10-10, but lost in 2-12-0 and 2-12-2) that was needed to make ROOT6 work with the Fermilab art framework.</li>

             <ul>
                <li>Final State Interaction (FSI) model bugifx - The model used to make unguarded checks in some circumstances on the probe type during FSI computations, but the probe isn't defined for nucleon decay models. So, in these cases, we would access a null pointer and create undefined behavior. That is now fixed.</li>
                <li>The Interaction package was patched to add an explicit streamer for `std::map<genie::KineVar_t,double>` which is required for reading back kinematics with newer versions of ROOT.</li>
                <li>Change in KineVar map streamer means `Kinematics` ClassDef need to be bumped to version 2.</li>
                <li>When using ROOT 6,  writing TTree branch `NtpMCEventRecord` refuses to be split, so don't event try (for now - will be revisited)</li>
                <li>When generating ROOT 6 dictionary generate .rootmap file and regularize .pcm file name to match library name.</li>
                <li>Minor fixes to header guards and to eliminate pedantic warnings.</li>

                <li>GENIE 2.10.8 contains patches to support ROOT5 and ROOT6 concurrently. There are no other changes.</li>

                <li>One important point users need to be aware about with this release is the name of the GENIE Cint macro. One of the requirements of the new ROOT 6 compiled macros is that a function can't have the same name as a namespace any more. That means the macro can no longer be called just "genie.C" - we've renamed it "genie_setup.C". This breaks backwards compatibility with any scripts that load GENIE libraries by running this macro. The executable that runs an interpreter session is still named "genie".</li>

                This release is almost identical to 2.8.4 with the only change being in how the <code>$LHAPATH</code> environment variable is handled and how the patched GRV98lo file is distributed.
                </p>
                <p>
                We removed the restriction on <code>$LHAPATH</code>. We now supply, in <code>$GENIE/data/evgen/pdfs</code>, the patched PDF.
                Please copy this to your <code>$LHAPATH area</code>. Note the PDF has a different name - it is <code>GRV98lo_patched.LHgrid</code>.
                This changed name is reflected in <code>$GENIE/config/PDFLIB.xml</code>.
                By default, GENIE will not run if you do not copy the patched PDF file to that area.
                If you would like to use the older, un-patched PDF, simply rename the PDF in the configuration XML to drop the <code>_patched</code> part of the filename.

              PDF overhaul (H. Gallagher and G. Perdue)
              <p>
              We recommend using LHAPDF5 and not Cernlib for PDFs. There is a bug in the version of GRV98lo that comes with
              LHAPDF5. We contacted the LHAPDF authors and they immediately provided a fixed file, but it must be distributed
              with GENIE as LHAPDF5 is frozen. The PDF set included here was producted by Graeme Watt (Durham, UK).
              The patched version recreates exactly:
               <a href=http://hepdata.cedar.ac.uk//hepdata/pdflib/grv/grv98/grv98.f>grv98.f</a>
             </p>
             <p>
             NOTE: In this version of GENIE, you MUST use the PDFs in $GENIE/data/evgen/pdfs with LHAPDF5. You MUST set your LHAPATH environemnt variable to $GENIE/data/evgen/pdfs!
             </p>
             <p>
              Our thanks to Graeme and LHAPDF for the patched file. Please note that this file will work only with LHAPDF 5.x and is not properly formatted for LHAPDF 6.

             Bug fix in the formation zones calculation for nucleons (H. Gallagher)
             <p>
              Prior versions of the GENIE implementation of the formation zone underestimated it for nucleons.

              <br />
              <br />
              New interaction processes:
              <ul>
                   <li> First implementation of a meson exchange current (MEC) event generator.
                        The CC MEC generator simulates CCQE-like scattering off nucleon clusters and is tuned to the CCQE-like rate
                        difference between the MiniBooNE data and the nominal CCQE expectation based on bubble chamber measurements on deuterium.
                        </li>
                   <li> Implemented inverse muon decay (IMD) annihilation channel
                        v&#772;<sub>e</sub> e<sup>-</sup> &rarr; &mu;<sup>-</sup> v&#772;<sub>&mu;</sub>.
                        Before, only v<sub>&mu;</sub> e<sup>-</sup> &rarr; &mu;<sup>-</sup> v<sub>e</sub> was implemented.
                        New code was contributed by Rosen Matev, Roumen Tsenov et al.
                        </li>
              </ul>

              Improvements in hadronic simulations:
              <ul>
                   <li> Major INTRANUKE code restructuring and deployment of an experimental version of the new hN INC model. </li>
                   <li> INTRANUKE particle stepping changes / additions:
                        &pi;<sup>-</sup>,&pi;<sup>+</sup> and n,p cross-section differences are taken into account.
                        The isospin of nuclear medium is treated properly.
                        </li>
                   <li> INTRANUKE hA addition:
                        More complete modeling of pion absorption and nucleon knockout processes based on
                        a parameterization of the hN model. The number of produced nucleons is chosen from a distribution,
                        then a phase space decay is used to set the nucleon kinematics.
                        </li>
                   <li> INTRANUKE hA addition:
                        Inelastic reactions now treated as quasielastic. Angle chosen from 2-body kinematics, includes binding
                        energy and Fermi motion.  Pauli blocking is included.
                        </li>
                   <li> INTRANUKE hA addition:
                        Pion production modeling now closer to data. Use compilation of data and fits for &pi;N&rarr;&pi;&pi;N
                        and for NN&rarr;&pi;NN. Kinematics generated vis phase space decays.
                        User has choice of including the effect of further intranuclear rescattering on intranuclear rescattering products
                        at the expense of reweighting unitarity (for currently available reweighting algorithm).
                        </li>
                   <li> INTRANUKE hA addition: Kaon rescattering </li>

              Event generation apps, neutrino fluxes and geometry drivers:
              <ul>
                   <li> Added nucleon-decay event generation application. Nuclear effects are simulated using the same models used for neutrino scattering.
                        The following decay modes are simulated:

                        </li>
                   <li> Overhaul of the GENIE FLUKA and BGLRS atmospheric neutrino flux drivers (contributed by Andy Blake).
                        The status of these drivers is now upgraded from experimental to production. </li>
                   <li> Updates to the NuMI flux driver: Allow for non-random initial entry.
                        Correct POT accumulation in case of flavor rejection and/or in case the flux is used for geometry exploration.
                        Allow vector of file patterns to be passed to the driver.
                        </li>
                   <li> Allow geometry exploration with rays of maximum neutrino energy. </li>

                  <ul>
                   <li> Bug-fix: Transition from KNO to Pythia6 (W range from 2.3 to 3.0 GeV) in AGKY was reversed (reported by Torben Ferber). </li>
                   <li> Bug-fix: Change the way the top volume name is matched in ROOT geometry navigation code. Previously the string length was not
                        required to be same and sometimes led to degeneracies and selection of incorrect top volume (reported by Kevin Connolly). </li>
                   <li> Bug-fix: The atmospheric flux driver was not generating flux vertices uniformly (per unit area) in the plane which is perpendicular to the flux neutrino direction
                        (reported by Torben Ferber). </li>
                   <li> Bug-fix: T2K flux driver was ignoring decay modes added in JNUBEAM version 10a (numu from K+ and K0, numubar from K- and K0, nue from pi+, nuebar from pi-).</li>
                   <li> Speed optimizations when generating events over complex detector geometries with neutrinos drawn from beam-line simulation ntuples.
                        Dramatic speed increases of 1-2 orders of magnitude can be achieved for event generation over complex geometries
                        (approaching speed of event generation for single nuclear targets).
                        Changes to the flux interface and GMCJDriver.
                        Currently only the T2K-specific event generation app employs the optimized scheme.

                  while 2.6.0 is in the works.
                  <ul>
                    <li> Bug-fix: Corrected Adler's PCAC CC suppression term in
                         the coherent pion production model (mpi -> mpi^2)</li>
                    <li> Bug-fix: Corrected pion kinematics in coherent pion production
                         scattering (the transverse momentum randomization in the LAB^{prime}
                         frame, z^{prime} is along \ver{q}, and the rotation from LAB^{prime} to LAB
                         were taking place in reversed order). </li>

                         record with different position 4-vector units than expected.</li>
                    <li> Bug-fix: Fixed a minor problem with the search for the maximum coherent differential
                         cross section, which was preventing coherent pion event kinematics from being
                         generated for energies very close to the energy threshold.</li>
                    <li> Requested feature: As per popular request, GENIE won't decay pi0's by
                         default. If you need to restore the previous behaviour
                         then toggle the `InhibitPi0Decay' flag. </li>
                    <li> Requested feature: Tweaked the JPARC flux driver and the T2K event
                         generation application to allow event generation for specific
                         neutrino flavours only.</li>
                    <li> Requested feature: Added option to generate events in specific
                         geometry volumes only.</li>
                    <li> Requested feature: Addded tool to generate NEUT-like cross section
                         table for SK MC job normalization. </li>
                    <li> Other: Updated Ar40 removal energy as per ArgoNEUT request.
                         Updated the PDG table. Added snapshot of the NuMI flux driver (as of the
                         v2.4.4 tagging date) for test runs by the NuMI expts.
                         Backported a version of gntpc that includes the implementation of the
                         `numi_rootracker' bare-ROOT format. Backported improvements to the gntpc

                  <ul>
                    <li> Significant speed improvements (event generation ~ x3 faster than 2.2.2 for event generation
                         for fixed initial state. ~ x1E+2 faster for event generation on ROOT geometries).</li>

                    <li> Installed new customized event generation application for T2K (gT2Kevgen, see $GENIE/src/support/t2k/EvGen)
                         including a driver for the JPARC neutrino flux

                    <li> Added simulation of nuclear de-excitation gamma rays for O16.</li>
                    <li> Added a preliminary implementation of anomaly mediated neutrino - photon interactions
                         [Harvey, Hill and Hill, PRL99,261601(2007)]</li>

                         to transverse cross section ratio R as an alternative to the existing Whitlow parameterization.</li>

                  A description of the physics model (cross section, hadronization and intranuclear rescattering
                  can be found in gDocDB-756, 757 and 758).
