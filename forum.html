     The user forum is supposed to be a regular meeting where users main developers can meet to give each other feedbacks
     about GENIE. The forum is held monthly, on the third Wednesday of each month at 15.00 GMT. Although this might change help the particpation of users all around the world.

     <br />

     The structure of the forum is variable, depending on the attendance and requested talks. Yet the general structure will be:
     <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
       <li> GENIE status report </li>
