         GENIE/Generator comprehensive model configurations
     </div>
     <div id="InsidePageSectionBody">

        Starting from v3.0.0, with the deployment of multiple comprehensive configurations (CMCs) and tunes,
        and the addition of a `--tune' argument in several apps, GENIE adopted the following uniform
        naming convention for its model configurations and tunes:
        <br />
        <br />
        A comprehensive model configuration is identified by a 7-character string in the form
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> <b> Gdd_MMv </b> </h3>
        where
        <ol type="1">
           <li>
             <b>G</b> is a capital letter that identifies the author of the tune.
             The default value is G (for the GENIE collaboration).
           </li>
           <li>
             <b>dd</b> is a number describing the year during which the model configuration was developed.
           </li>
           <li>
             <b>MM</b> is a number (00, 01, 02, ...) identifying a model configuration branch.
           </li>
           <li>
             <b>v</b> is a character (a, b, c, ...) enumerating variations / offshoots of a model configuration branch.
           </li>
       </ol>

       <br />
       <b>Note on test configurations</b>: 
       <br />
       <i>Test</i> comprehensive model configurations being developed, validated and tuned for deployment in future releases
       may be created temporarily and appear in public releases. 
       This would allow users to experiment with early versions of these comprehensive models,
       making sure that these experimental models and their features are properly configured by GENIE.
       These configurations may not necessarily follow the above naming convention and 
       should be identified by the use of an initial <b>GTEST</b>.
       Users are warned that <i>test</i> comprehensive model configurations may not be fully validated or tuned,
       and that their very definition may subject to changes before they emerge as an officially supported tune.
       We welcome feedback on these early snapshots of future model configurations but, for as long as they are classified as test
       configurations, support will be limited and we may not prioritise bug-fix revisions to address issues in test configurations.
     </div>

     <br />

     <div id="InsidePageSectionHeader">
         GENIE/Generator tunes
     </div>
     <div id="InsidePageSectionBody">

       Once a comprehensive model configuration is defined, a number of different tunes may be produced.
       Each distinct choice of a) fit datasets and dataset weighting scheme, b) parameters of interest and nuisance parameters,
       and c) prior constraints, leads to a different tune. A tune is identified by the model configuration name, and additional
       information enumerating the parameters and datasets. This is a 14-character string in the form
       <h3 style="text-align:center;"> <b> Gdd_MMv_PP_xxx </b> </h3>
       where
       <ol type="1">
         <li> <b>Gdd_MMv</b> describes the model configuration (see above).
         </li>
         <li> <b>PP</b> is a number identifying the set of tuned parameters.
              This parameter set is defined uniquely only in the context of a particular model configuration.
              The number 00 indicates that a model configuration has not been tuned by GENIE.
         </li>
         <li> <b>xxx</b> is a number that identifies the dataset used for the model configuration tuning.
              This may include a unique set weights associated with each component dataset.
              The number 00 indicates that a model configuration has not been tuned by GENIE.
