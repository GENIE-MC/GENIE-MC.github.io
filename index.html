            <b>GENIE</b> is an <A href="./collaboration.html"><b>international collaboration</b></A> of scientists that
            plays the leading role in 
            a) the development of a modern and universal event generator framework and tools in support of neutrino experiments,

               11th March 2022: New production release 3.2.0!
             </div>
             <div CLASS="clsFrontPageTabBody">
               We are pleased to announce that version 3.02.00 of the GENIE event generator has been tagged.
               <br />
               <br />
               This is an important new release that introduces several new models and tools.
               The details of the improvements is available <A href="http://releases.genie-mc.org" target="_top">here</A>.
               <br />
               Physics improvements span from low-energy physics (implementation of a new CEvNS event generator) to
               ultra high energies (implementation of new NLO DIS models and event generators
               in support of the neutrino telescope and FPF users). In addition, new BSM models (dark neutrino,
               and improved boosted dark matter simulations) were introduced, together with new interfaces to
               the Liege/INCL and G4/Bertini intranuclear cascades, and several new tunes.
               <br />
               <br />
               Some of these new models and event generator mechanisms are discussed in our recent paper
               published in 
               <A href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjs/s11734-021-00295-7" target="_top">
                  Eur.Phys.J.ST 230 (2021) 24</A>
               <br />
               <br />
               The new code, as always, is available from 
               our <A href="https://github.com/GENIE-MC" target="_top">GitHub repositories</A>
               In case of problems, feel free to open GitHub issues and submit pull requests!
               <br />
               <br />
               The User and Physics manual has been updated with some of the new developments. 
               <br />
               <br />
               We look forward to your feedback.
