            <b>GENIE</b> is an <b>international collaboration</b> of scientists that
            plays the leading role in 
            a) the development of a modern and universal event generator framework and tools in support of neutrino experiments,
            b) the consistent, validated and efficient implementation of a constellation of alternative physics models within a common platform,  
            c) the development and characterisation of novel <b><u>comprehensive</u> physics models</b> for the <b>simulation
            of neutrino interactions</b>, and 
            d) the development of an advanced <b>global analysis of neutrino scattering data</b>.
            <br />
            <br />
            The GENIE collaboration
            <b>maintains a popular suite of software products</b> 
            (including the
             <A href="https://github.com/GENIE-MC/Generator" target="_top"><i><b>Generator</b></i></A>, 
             <A href="https://github.com/GENIE-MC/Comparisons" target="_top"><i><b>Comparisons</b></i></A>, 
             <A href="https://github.com/GENIE-MC/Tuning" target="_top"><i><b>Tuning</b></i></A>, and 
             <A href="https://github.com/GENIE-MC/Reweight" target="_top"><i><b>Reweight</b></i></A> products)
            for the experimental neutrino community.
            <br />
            <br />
            The well-known <i>Generator</i> implements a modern framework for Monte Carlo event generators and 
            includes state-of-the-art physics modules. The <b>GENIE physics model is universal and comprehensive</b>:
            It handles all neutrinos and targets, and all processes relevant from MeV to PeV energy scales.
            The <i>Generator</i> includes several tools (flux drivers, detector geometry navigation drivers, 
            and specialized event generation apps)
            to <b>simulate complex experimental setups in full detail</b>.
            The GENIE <i>Generator</i> is <b>used by nearly all modern neutrino experiments</b> and its
            predictions serve as standard reference points for the neutrino community.
            <br />
            <br />
            The <i>Comparisons</i> product includes very <b>extensive curated archives of neutrino, charged-lepton 
            and hadron scattering data</b>, as well as highly-developed software to produce a 
            <b>comprehensive set of data/MC comparisons</b>.
            It includes embedded <b>interfaces to the <A href="https://professor.hepforge.org">Professor</A> tuning tool</b>
            which "<i>reduces the exponentially expensive process of brute-force tuning to a scaling closer to a power 
            law in the number of parameters and allows for massive parallelisation</i>".
            The <i>Comparisons</i> product plays a key role in comprehensive model characterization in GENIE,
            it underpins the GENIE global analysis, and it enabled the production of several new tunes.
            <br />
            <br />
            The <i>Tuning</i> product implements
            the <b>powerfull new GENIE global analysis of neutrino scattering data</b>. 
            The GENIE global analysis produces <b>physics tunes which are fully integrated in the 
            <i>Generator</i> product</b>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Finally, the <i>Reweight</i> product includes a selection of tools to <b>propagate model uncertainties 
            and to support generator-related analysis tasks</b>. 
            The reweighting procedure has inherent limitations. Important modelling systematics are not reweightable 
            in principle and they have no corresponding weight calculator in the <i>Reweight</i> product.
            Indeed, the GENIE tuning procedure itself makes no use of the Reweight product but it relies on response
            functions constructed from brute-force parameter scans made with the aid of the Professor tool.
            Currently, the <i>Reweight</i> product it does not provide the full systematic error 
            for any GENIE tune. However, we have <b>medium-term plans to overhaul this product</b> and use it for
            <b>public release of the detailed Professor/YODA response functions</b> constructed from our 
            brute-force systematic parameter scans, as well as to 
            release all covariance matrices from the GENIE global fits of neutrino scattering data. 
            The upgraded <i>Reweight</i> product will support all public GENIE physics tunes!
