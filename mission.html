        <li> 
         The GENIE Collaboration shall <b>provide a state-of-the-art neutrino MC generator for the 
         world experimental neutrino community</b>. GENIE shall simulate all processes for all neutrino 
         species and nuclear targets, from MeV to PeV energy scales.
        </li> 

        <br />
 
        <li>
         The GENIE Collaboration shall provide electron-nucleus, hadron-nucleus and nucleon decay 
         generators in the same physics framework as the neutrino-nucleus generator.
        </li>

        <br />

        <li>
          The GENIE Collaboration shall <b>review critically all relevant theoretical work and 
          experimental data</b> and it shall <b>synthesize selected physics models and data into a 
          comprehensive and self-consistent picture of neutrino interaction physics</b>.
        </li> 

        <br />

        <li>
          The GENIE Collaboration shall <b>curate archives of the world neutrino scattering data, 
          and a large sample of complementary charged lepton and hadron scattering data</b>, 
          and it shall make those archives available in digital form for the purpose of neutrino 
          interaction model validation, tuning and systematic error evaluation.
        </li>

        <br />

        <li>
          The GENIE Collaboration shall <b>perform global fits</b> to neutrino, charged-lepton and 
          hadron scattering data and <b>provide global neutrino interaction model tunes</b>.
        </li>

        <br />

        <li>
          The GENIE Collaboration shall provide a complete <b>systematic analysis of its default model.</b>
        </li>

        <br />

        <li>
          The GENIE Collaboration shall <b>provide expert advice to the world neutrino community</b> on 
          matters related to neutrino interaction phenomenology based on in-depth knowledge of 
          relevant scattering data and the experience building a comprehensive model of neutrino 
          interaction physics. It shall also expert advice on all technical matters related to the 
          realistic simulation of complex experimental environments.
        </li>

        <br />

        <li>
          The GENIE Collaboration shall <b>provide tools to support the full life-cycle of simulation 
          and generator-related analysis tasks</b>, including a) a suite of neutrino flux and detector 
          geometry navigation drivers which allow event generation for realistic, arbitrarily complex 
          experimental setups using off-the-shelf components, b) standardised event generation 
          applications for all major experiments, and c) event reweighting code allowing the propagation 
          of generator-level uncertainties into physics analyses.
