     GENIE is a <b>suite of software products</b> 
     (<i>Generator, Comparisons, Tuning, Reweight, AVS-CI, Lamp, UnitTests, Prof-GENIE</i>) 
     and <b>documentation products</b> 
     (<i>Physics and User Manual, Tutorials</i>)
     for the <b>experimental neutrino physics community</b>. 
     <br />
     <br />
     All GENIE products are hosted in the <A href="https://github.com/GENIE-MC"> Official GENIE GitHub organization</A>.
     <br />
     <br />
     Several, though not all, GENIE products have source code releases
     that can be found in <i>public</i> repositories of our official GitHub organization page.
     All such GENIE products hosted in <i>public</i> repositories are <b>distributed partially

     The GENIE authors are convinced of the benefits of distributing the source code of 
     certain GENIE products for scientific use, allowing <b>local modifications</b> to meet 
     the specific requirements of the individual user.
     This gives users considerable freedom 
     and we expect you to use it wisely so that we can continue providing the source code.

       GENIE / Generator
     </div>
     <div id="GenieSuiteProductText">
        The <i>Generator</i> implements a modern software framework for neutrino Monte Carlo generators
        and state-of-the-art physics modules allowing the simulation of neutrino-nucleus interactions
        over a wide energy range for all neutrino species and nuclear targets.
        With a wealth of integrated tools such as flux drivers, detector geometry navigation drivers,
        generic event generation apps and specialised event generation apps for several
        experiments, the <i>Generator</i> supports neutrino interaction simulation for complex 
        and realistic experimental setups.

       GENIE / Comparisons
     </div>
     <div id="GenieSuiteProductText">
        The <i>Comparisons</i> include extensive curated archives of neutrino, charged-lepton and 
        hadron-nucleus scattering data, as well as software to produce a comprehensive set of data/MC comparisons.
        It underpins the GENIE global analysis of neutrino scattering data.

        The Comparisons package is not distributed publicly, but the results of this package and 
        comprehensive characterization of all GENIE tunes are made available to the community.
        <br />
        The package, in whole or in parts, can be made available to experimental collaborations 
        under a special agreement and strictly for internal use.
        GENIE reserves the exclusive right of the use of <i>Comparisons</i>
        for the purpose of developing publicly available physics tunes and well as for 
        publicly available comprehensive model charaterizations and systematic error analyses.
