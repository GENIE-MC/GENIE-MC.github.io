     GENIE is a <b>suite of products</b> 
     (Generator, Comparisons, Tuning, Reweight)
     for the experimental neutrino physics community. 
     These products have different licenses.

       GENIE / Generator
     </div>
     <div id="GenieSuiteProductText">
        The <i>Generator</i> implements a modern software framework for neutrino Monte Carlo generators
        and state-of-the-art physics modules allowing the simulation of neutrino-nucleus interactions
        over a wide energy range for all neutrino species and nuclear targets.
        With a wealth of integrated tools such as flux drivers, detector geometry navigation drivers,
        generic event generation apps and specialised event generation apps for several
        experiments, the <i>Generator</i> supports neutrino interaction simulation for complex 
        and realistic experimental setups.

       GENIE / Comparisons
     </div>
     <div id="GenieSuiteProductText">
        The <i>Comparisons</i> include extensive curated archives of neutrino, charged-lepton and 
        hadron-nucleus scattering data, as well as software to produce a comprehensive set of data/MC comparisons.
        It underpins the GENIE global analysis of neutrino scattering data.

        </H3>
        The Comparisons package is not distributed publicly, but the results of this package and 
        comprehensive characterization of all GENIE tunes are made available to the community.
        <br />
        The package, in whole or in parts, can be made available to experimental collaborations 
        under a special agreement and strictly for internal use.
        GENIE reserves the exclusive right of the use of <i>Comparisons</i>
        for the purpose of developing publicly available physics tunes and well as for 
        publicly available comprehensive model charaterizations and systematic error analyses.

     <div id="GenieSuiteProductHeader">
       GENIE / Tuning
     </div>
     <div id="GenieSuiteProductText">
        The <i>Tuning</i> implements a neutrino generator tuning framework and 
        includes applications implementing the <i>GENIE tuning procedure</i>.

           Copyright &copy; 2003-2019, The GENIE Collaboration, All rights reserved
        </H3>
        The Tuning package is not distributed publicly, although selected <em> results</em> 
        are made available to the community as <em>GENIE tunes</em> implemented in the Generator package.

     <div id="GenieSuiteProductHeader">
       GENIE / Reweight
     </div>
     <div id="GenieSuiteProductText">
        The <i>Reweight</i> implements a selection of tools to propagate model uncertainties and to 
        support generator-related analysis tasks. It is intended strictly for the deployment of the 
        GENIE systematic error analysis and to support the physics tunes produced from the GENIE 
        global analysis of neutrino scattering data.
