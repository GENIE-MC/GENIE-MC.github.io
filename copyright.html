     GENIE is a <b>suite of software products</b> 
     (<i>Generator, Comparisons, Tuning, Reweight, AVS-CI, Lamp, UnitTests, Prof-GENIE</i>) 
     and <b>documentation products</b> 
     (<i>Physics and User Manual, Tutorials</i>)
     for the <b>experimental neutrino physics community</b>. 
     <br />
     <br />
     All GENIE products are hosted in the <A href="https://github.com/GENIE-MC"> Official GENIE GitHub organization</A>.
     <br />
     <br />
     Several GENIE products, including all those related with the service component of our work,
     such as providing an event generator platform, physics model implementations and associated tools 
     (<i>Generator, Reweight, AVS-CI, Lamp, UnitTests</i>)
     have source code releases
     that can be found in <i>public</i> repositories of our official GitHub organization page.
     <br />
     <br />
     Other GENIE products, especially those coupled with our dual function of developing 
     a proprietary global analysis of neutrino scattering data
     (<i>Comparisons, Tuning, Prof-GENIE</i>)
     do not have source code releases (common practise for HEP global analyses).
     Instead, it is our analysis results, obtained using those closed-source products,
     which are made publicly available through our open-source products.
     GENIE closed-source products are hosted in 
     <i>private</i> repositories of our official GitHub organization page.
     <br />
     <br />

     GENIE reserves all rights on the distribution, development and use 
     of its closed-source products hosted in private repositories of      
     its Official GitHub organization.
     <br />
     <br />

     GENIE reserves all rights on the distribution, development and use 
     of all its products for the purpose of non-academic applications.
     <br />
     <br />

     GENIE reserves all rights on the distribution, development and use 
     of all its products for the purpose of academic applications with broad, 
     community-wide scope (such as providing common event generation frameworks,
     tools and models for multiple experiments).
     <br />
     <br />

     For small-scale academic use (e.g. ranging from use within a University group up to use
     within a single experiment), all such GENIE products hosted in <i>public</i> repositories 
     are <b>distributed partially
        under the <A href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html">
           GNU General Public License (GPLv3)</A></b>.
     <br />
     <br />
     The GENIE authors are convinced of the benefits of distributing the source code of 
     certain GENIE products for scientific use, allowing <b>local modifications</b> to meet 
     the specific requirements of the individual user.
     This gives users considerable freedom 
     and we expect you to use it wisely so that we can continue providing the source code.
     The GPLv3 license doesn't address issues specific to academic software 
     and we include below an <b>additional set of terms</b>
     (known as the <b>MCnet Guidelines for Fair Academic Usage</b>)
     that we <b>require you to follow</b>.
     <br />
     <br />

     <div id="MCNetGuidelines">
          The <b>MCnet Guidelines for Fair Academic Usage</b>,
          were edited by Nils Lavesson and David Grellscheid for the MCnet collaboration.
          The guidelines can be found: <A href="./MCNET_GUIDELINES.txt">here</A>.

     Additional GENIE products are contributed by the community and they are hosted by
     <A href="https://github.com/orgs/GENIE-MC-Community">Community GENIE GitHub orgranization</A>.     
     The license of such contributed products, if any, is set by the original contributing authors.
     GENIE does not maintain nor support those products.
